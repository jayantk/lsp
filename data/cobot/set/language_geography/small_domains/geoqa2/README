This directory contains the GeoQA data set. The environments/ folder
contains the training data, with each environment in its own
subdirectory. Each environment directory contains the following files:

- locations.txt -- The names of the location entities in the
  environment, along with an OpenStreetMap ID which can be used to
  obtain the entity's polygon.

- training.txt -- Questions with annotated denotations and logical
  forms. This file is semicolon delimited, in the form (question,
  comma-separated denotation, difficulty level, logical form). Logical
  forms are expressed in LISP-like notation. Predicates of the form
  "kb-XXX" uniquely select entity "XXX".

- world.txt -- Annotated sets of entities for each predicate. Only
  predicates which occur in at least one logical form are included.

- cat_features.txt -- Features of the category classifier (i.e., of
  each entity). One feature per line in a comma-separated format.

- rel_features.txt -- Features of the relation classifier (i.e., of
  each entity pair). One feature per line in comma-separated format.

Additionally, the poylgons/ directory contains the original polygons
from which the category and relation features were computed. These
polygons were obtained from OpenStreetMap (openstreetmap.org), and are
represented in their XML format (see
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim).
